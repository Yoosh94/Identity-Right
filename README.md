# Identity-Right

##Summary
Identity Right is a project being designed and developed by Deakin University students who are perusing a degree in Information Technology. Identity Right attempts to assist everyday people to manage their postal address with organisations they are subscribed or registered to. By using our centralized system, users can rest assured that when they move houses they can change their address in one convenient location and all the organisations they are linked to will be updated. On top of this, the platform is beneficial for organisations as well. By using our system organisations are satisfied that the mailing address for their customers is up to date all the time which reduces the cost of lost mail and angry customers who claim to have received no mail. The system ideally will sign users up automatically and require minimal user input for their convenience. In the future Identity Right has the potential to be used to check other current details such as email address, phone number, mobile number and also be integrated into websites as a way to log in securely. For Identity Right to work, we need users and organisations to work hand in hand. Without one of the sides, the other will be useless. Our main target audience would be young adults who are still in the process of studying or finding jobs because they will be relocating more often than a well settled family with children.
