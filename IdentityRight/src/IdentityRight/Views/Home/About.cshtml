    <h4>What do we do.</h4>
    <p>
        Identity Right attempts to assist everyday people to manage their postal address with organisations they are subscribed or registered to.
        By using our centralized system, users can rest assured that when they move houses they can change their address in one convenient location and
        all the organisations they are linked to will be updated. On top of this, the platform is beneficial for organisations as well.
        By using our system organisations are satisfied that the mailing address for their customers is up to date all the time
        which reduces the cost of lost mail and angry customers who claim to have received no mail.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system ideally will sign users up automatically and require minimal user input for their convenience.
        In the future Identity Right has the potential to be used to check other current details such as email address, phone number,
        mobile number and also be integrated into websites as a way to log in securely.
        For Identity Right to work, we need users and organisations to work hand in hand. Without one of the sides, the other will be useless.
        Our main target audience would be young adults who are still in the process of studying or
        finding jobs because they will be relocating more often than a well settled family with children.

                <h2>We making moving houses easier and stress free!</h2>
                <p>
                    When people change their location they are required to update their address details with all their organisations and government agencies. A single person can have affiliations with hundreds of organisations. Manually updating these details can become cumbersome and stressful during a time that can already be stressful. Time is not only wasted, but some government agencies require prompt updates, with legal ramifications for failing to do so. There is also the possibility of people not receiving important mail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is currently no efficient way to address this problem. Identity Right, aims to address this problem by creating a central system that allows <b>you</b> to store these details. You will have the freedom to always update your details using one easy interface. With your permission organisations will be able to access this data to ensure that they always have up to date information about you.
                </p>
